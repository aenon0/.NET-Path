Clean Architecture is a prominent architectural paradigm that distinguishes itself among various architectural approaches.
This methodology boasts several benefits, such as enhanced modularity, scalability, and testability, among others. However,
it is not devoid of drawbacks, including a potentially steep learning curve and increased complexity. When delving into the
implementation of Clean Architecture in C#, a prudent starting point involves the delineation of subfolders, namely "api,"
"Core," "Infrastructure," and "Ui." Within the "Core" subfolder, two vital projects find their place: "application" and 
"domain." The "domain" project centers around entities and encompasses the essence of the system, while the "application"
project acts as the conduit for exposing the domain, facilitating seamless interaction between external applications and the
domain layer, all while ensuring the autonomy of the domain layer remains intact.
